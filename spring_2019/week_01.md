## Intro
Name: Covenant Faluyi
Project: Teetor
## Last Week's Accomplishments


> This past week, I familiarized myself with the repository of the project. I learned about the different components in the project and the tools needed to debug them. For example, I went through using Postman to make API calls. 

> One such API call had the functionality of getting all the users stored in our database. I made use of the API call and stored the result in the redux state. To do so, I had to create a redux action with a payload containing the result of the api call. I made a reducer to process the action and update the state with the payload.
> After storing all users in the state, I made use of our card components and mapped a card component for each user. The result was rows of card components representing registered users in the website.

## This Week's Plan

> I plan to fix the 'bulb' images on the user card components. They are meant to represent the average rating of a user on the website but currently they do not work. After I fix this, I may move on to making a api call for 'rating' users.

## Anything Blocking?

> At the moment there are no technical blockers.
